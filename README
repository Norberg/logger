This application requirer that the arduino is programmed with
this or compatible software:
http://github.com/Norberg/sensors
easily cloneable with:
git clone git://github.com/Norberg/sensors.git

This application prefers if it can find the arduino device at 
/dev/arduino its possible to change port in readSensor.py to
point to elsewhere but not recommended since it will differ
depending on other device connected, instead write a udev rule
that takes care of it.

Create a new file in /etc/udev/rules.d called local.rules and put:
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb",ATTRS{interface}=="FT232R USB UART",KERNEL=="ttyUSB*",SYMLINK+="arduino"

Where ATTRS{interface} is the same as found with:
sudo udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/tty/ttyUSB0 | grep interface

Then replug the device and /dev/arduino should appear.
